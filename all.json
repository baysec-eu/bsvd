      "description": "Double Commander (v1.1.23 and prior) attempts to load certain DLLs (e.g., libheif.dll, librsvg.2-2.dll) from locations not securely bundled with the application. An attacker with write access to any directory in the system PATH may insert a malicious DLL to achieve arbitrary code execution. If the application is launched with administrative privileges, this can result in full system compromise. This vulnerability aligns with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1574.002: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading and can be leveraged by adversaries post-exploitation to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.",
